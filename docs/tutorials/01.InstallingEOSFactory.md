# Installing *EOSFactory*

The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to install *EOSFactory* on any operating system, including Ubuntu, MacOS and Windows.

We've tested *EOSFactory* on the following platforms:

- Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic)
- MacOS 10.13 (High Sierra)
- Windows 10 (version 1803)

**NOTE:** *EOSFactory* is compatible with *EOSIO* [v1.6.0](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/releases/tag/v1.6.0).

## General prerequisites

We assume that you have successfully installed [*EOSIO*](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos) v1.6.0 on your machine. Binary installation suffices.

*EOSIO* deployed in Docker is NOT supported.

Also, we assume that you have installed [*eosio.cdt*](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.cdt) v1.41. Binary installation suffices.

## Prerequisites for Ubuntu & MacOS

* We assume you have installed [Python 3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-356/) (or higher).
* We assume you have installed [pip 18.1](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) (or higher).

## Prerequisites for Windows

- We assume that you have [*Windows Subsystem for Linux - Ubuntu 18.04*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu-1804/9n9tngvndl3q) installed.
- Both EOSIO and eosio.cdt are installed to the Windows Ubuntu bash. If you want to compile them from sources, we recommend that they are cloned in the Windows file structure, taking advantage of the fact that the entire Windows file structure is fully accessible in WSL.
- And finally, we assume you have [Python 3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-356/) (or higher) available in your WSL, but this condition is likely to be already satisfied, as WSL ships with Python 3.6.5 by default. Also make sure your WSL has [pip 18.1](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) (or higher) installed.

## Python dependencies

EOSFactory depends on the following not standard Python packages:

```bash
pip3 install termcolor
pip3 install setuptools
```

## Install on Ubuntu & MacOS

Clone *EOSFactory* source code from the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tokenika/eosfactory.git
```

Open a bash terminal and navigate to the `eosfactory` folder:

```bash
cd eosfactory
```

Then run the `install` script by pointing it to the *EOSIO* source code:

```bash
./install.sh
```

When prompted, supply the path pointing to the location of your smart-contract workspace, e.g. `~/Workspaces/EOS/contracts`. It has to be existent, so if you don't have it already, you need to create it manually.

## Install on Windows

Clone *EOSFactory* source code from the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tokenika/eosfactory.git
```

>**NOTE:** We recommend keeping *EOSFactory* in the Windows file structure that is accessible to WSL.

Open a WSL bash terminal and navigate to the `eosfactory` folder:

```bash
cd /mnt/d/Workspaces/EOS/eosfactory
```

Then run the `install` script by pointing it to the *EOSIO* source code:

```bash
./install.sh
```

When prompted, supply the path pointing to the location of your smart-contract workspace, e.g. `/mnt/d/Workspaces/EOS/contracts`. It has to be existent, so if you don't have it already, you need to create it manually.

## Verify the installation

Now let's verify that EOSFactory works and is properly hooked up to *EOSIO*.

First, make sure your working directory is switched to `eosfactory`:

```bash
cd eosfactory
```

And then run those three tests:

```bash
python3 tests/hello_world.py
python3 tests/eosio_token.py
python3 tests/tic_tac_toe.py
```
## Install from PyPi repository

The current edition supports installation with the Python pip system. However, EOSFactory installed as a plain Python module is stripped of the shell utilities that come with the GitHub repository, mentioned above:

* test scripts,
* tutorials, some of them executable.

The versions, GitHub and PyPi are identical in the code. They differ in their data folders. The configuration of any one can be printed with the command:

```bash
python3 -m eosfactory.config
```

In the printout, you cen see a note about the nature of the active package:

```bash
EOSFactory version 2.1.3.
Dependencies:
https://github.com/EOSIO/eos version 1.6.0
https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.cdt version 1.4.1
Python version 3.5 or higher

        EOSFactory is installed as a Python package.

The current configuration of EOSFactory:
{
    "CONFIG_FILE": "/home/cartman/.local/eosfactory/config/config.json",
    "EOSIO_CLI_EXECUTABLE": "/usr/bin/cleos",
    "EOSIO_CONTRACT_WORKSPACE": "/mnt/",    
..........................................
..........................................
```
where the message *EOSFactory is installed as a Python package.* indicates the PyPi origin.


You can install the pypi EOSFactory with the usual `pip` command:
```bash
pip3 install eosfactory
```

## Troubleshooting specific errors

### `nodeos --version` error

There is a bug in `eosio nodeos` executable that makes it to response erratically. 
The command `python3 -m eosfactory.config` attempts to verify the version of the EOSIO installation -- unsuccessfully quite frequently issuing the following error message:
  
```bash
ERROR!
Cannot determine the version of the installed 'eosio' package.
The error message:
Command '['/usr/bin/nodeos', '--version']' returned non-zero exit status 255.
```

## Troubleshooting general problems

### Verify EOSFactory configuration

Make sure *EOSFactory* configuration is correct by running this command:

```bash
python3 -m eosfactory.config
```

As a result, you should get data similar to this:

```bash
.......................................

The current configuration of EOSFactory:
{
    "CONFIG_FILE": "/mnt/c/Workspaces/EOS/eosfactory/config/config.json",
    "EOSIO_CLI_EXECUTABLE": "/usr/bin/cleos",
    "EOSIO_CONTRACT_WORKSPACE": "/mnt/c/Workspaces/EOS/eosfactory/contracts_windows",
    "EOSIO_CPP": "/usr/bin/eosio-cpp",
    "EOSIO_CPP_DIR": "/usr/opt/eosio.cdt/1.5.0/",
    "EOSIO_CPP_INCLUDES": [
        "/usr/opt/eosio.cdt/1.5.0/include",
        "/usr/opt/eosio.cdt/1.5.0/include/eosiolib",
        "/usr/opt/eosio.cdt/1.5.0/include/libc",
        "/usr/opt/eosio.cdt/1.5.0/include/libcxx"
    ],
    "EOSIO_GENESIS_JSON": "/home/cartman/.local/share/eosio/nodeos/config/genesis.json",
    "EOSIO_KEY_PRIVATE": "5KQwrPbwdL6PhXujxW37FSSQZ1JiwsST4cqQzDeyXtP79zkvFD3",
    "EOSIO_KEY_PUBLIC": "EOS6MRyAjQq8ud7hVNYcfnVPJqcVpscN5So8BhtHuGYqET5GDW5CV",
    "EOSIO_SHARED_MEMORY_SIZE_MB": "200",
    "EOS_FACTORY_DIR": "/mnt/c/Workspaces/EOS/eosfactory",
    "KEOSD_EXECUTABLE": "/usr/bin/keosd",
    "KEOSD_WALLET_DIR": "/home/cartman/eosio-wallet/",
    "LOCAL_NODE_ADDRESS": "127.0.0.1:8888",
    "LOCAL_NODE_CONFIG_DIR": "/mnt/c/Workspaces/EOS/eosfactory/config",
    "LOCAL_NODE_DATA_DIR": "/home/cartman/.local/share/eosio/nodeos/data/",
    "LOCAL_NODE_EXECUTABLE": "/usr/bin/nodeos",
    "NODEOS_STDOUT": null,
    "WALLET_MANAGER_ADDRESS": "127.0.0.1:8888",
    "WSL_ROOT": "C:/Users/cartman/AppData/Local/Packages/CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc/LocalState/rootfs"
}

.......................................

```

Next, note the entries of the value `null`. Some of them signal configuration errors.

### Verify command lines

Technically, EOSFactory wraps EOSIO executables -- namely `cleos`, `keos`, `nodeos` -- with its own API. Therefore, in error conditions, it make sense to inspect command lines sent to the EOSIO executables. The boolean variable `eosfactory.core.setup.is_print_command_line` sets the debug status. For example, if deployment of the contract in the test script `hello_world.py` fails, modify the script:

```python
        import eosfactory.core.setup as setUp   ## added
        setup.is_print_command_line = True      ## added
        contract.build()
        contract.deploy()
        setup.is_print_command_line = False     ## added
```

Now, if you run the script, you can see raw bash commands that can be inspected and tried:

```bash
######## command line sent to eosio-cpp:
/usr/bin/eosio-cpp -I=/mnt/c/Workspaces/EOS/eosfactory/contracts_windows/_wslqwjvacdyugodewiyd /mnt/c/Workspaces/EOS/eosfactory/contracts_windows/_wslqwjvacdyugodewiyd/src/_wslqwjvacdyugodewiyd.cpp:
WASM file writen to file: 
    /mnt/c/Workspaces/EOS/eosfactory/contracts_windows/_wslqwjvacdyugodewiyd/build/_wslqwjvacdyugodewiyd.wasm
######## command line sent to cleos:
/usr/bin/cleos --url http://127.0.0.1:8888 set contract kswquviprmbi /mnt/c/Workspaces/EOS/eosfactory/contracts_windows/_wslqwjvacdyugodewiyd build/_wslqwjvacdyugodewiyd.wasm build/_wslqwjvacdyugodewiyd.abi
```

### Verify communication with `cleos`

EOSFactory offers another debugging tool: printing requests send by `cleos` to nodeos, and responses from nodeos. For example, if deployment of the contract in the test script hello_world.py fails, modify the script:

```python
        import eosfactory.core.setup as setUp   ## added
        setup.is_print_command_line = True      ## added
        setup.is_print_request = True           ## added
        # setup.is_print_response = True        ## volume printout
        contract.build()
        contract.deploy()
        setup.is_print_request = False          ## added
        setup.is_print_command_line = False     ## added
        setup.is_print_response = False         ## added
```

We cannot show the effect of the setup: it is very volume. 

## Subsequent installations

If you want to upgrade to the latest version of *EOSFactory*:

```bash
cd eosfactory
git pull
```

And then just run:

```bash
./install.sh
```
I see, you use the contribution from ED Easy-D (Pull request: "Fix unrecognised option 'max-implicit-request' error on startup").
We will include it to the next distribution of EOSFactory.
