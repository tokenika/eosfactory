# Installing *EOSFactory*

The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to install *EOSFactory* on any operating system, including Ubuntu, MacOS and Windows.

We've tested *EOSFactory* on the following platforms:

- Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic)
- MacOS 10.13 (High Sierra_1)
- Windows 10 (version 1803)

## General prerequisites

We assume that you have successfully installed [*EOSIO*](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos) v1.7.1 on your machine. Binary installation suffices.

*EOSIO* deployed in Docker is NOT supported.

Also, we assume that you have installed [*eosio.cdt*](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.cdt) v1.6.1. Binary installation suffices.

## Prerequisites for Ubuntu & MacOS

* We assume you have installed [Python 3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-356/) (or higher).
* We assume you have installed [pip3 18.1](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) (or higher).

## Prerequisites for Windows

- We assume that you have [*Windows Subsystem for Linux - Ubuntu 18.04*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu-1804/9n9tngvndl3q) installed.
- We assume that both *EOSIO* and *EOSIO.CDT* are installed to the Windows Ubuntu bash. If you prefer to compile them from sources, we recommend cloning them in the Windows file structure, taking advantage of the fact that the entire Windows file structure is fully accessible in WSL.
- And finally, we assume you have [Python 3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-356/) (or higher) available in your WSL, but this condition is likely to be already satisfied, as WSL ships with Python 3.6.5 by default. Also make sure your WSL has [pip3 18.1](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) (or higher) installed.
- It is advisable to have Python installed on the Windows side, as well: this enables using a [linter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) with the scripts on the Ubuntu side.

## Python dependencies

EOSFactory depends on the following not standard Python packages:

```bash
pip3 install --user termcolor
```

## Install on Ubuntu & MacOS

Clone *EOSFactory* source code from the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tokenika/eosfactory.git
```

Open a bash terminal and navigate to the `eosfactory` folder:

```bash
cd eosfactory
```

Then run the `install` script by pointing it to the *EOSIO* source code:

```bash
./install.sh
```

When prompted, supply the path pointing to the location of your smart-contract workspace, e.g. `~/Workspaces/EOS/contracts`. It has to be existent, so if you don't have it already, you need to create it manually.

## Install on Windows

Clone *EOSFactory* source code from the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tokenika/eosfactory.git
```

>**NOTE:** We recommend keeping *EOSFactory* in the Windows file structure that is accessible to WSL.

Open a WSL bash terminal and navigate to the `eosfactory` folder:

```bash
cd /mnt/d/Workspaces/EOS/eosfactory
```

Then run the `install` script by pointing it to the *EOSIO* source code:

```bash
./install.sh
```

When prompted, supply the path pointing to the location of your smart-contract workspace, e.g. `/mnt/d/Workspaces/EOS/contracts`. It has to be existent, so if you don't have it already, you need to create it manually.

## Verify the installation

Now let's verify that EOSFactory works and is properly hooked up to *EOSIO*:

```bash
python3 -m eosfactory.config
```

Now, you can try tests. Make sure your working directory is switched to `eosfactory`:

```bash
cd eosfactory
```

And then run those three tests:

```bash
python3 tests/hello_world.py
python3 tests/eosio_token.py
python3 tests/tic_tac_toe.py
```

## Install from PyPi repository
Since the `v3.0.0` release, *EOSFactory* supports installation with the `pip3` installer. *EOSFactory* installed as a plain Python module is stripped of the goods that come with the GitHub repository, mentioned above:
* test scripts,
* tutorials, some of them executable.

Instead, the *EOSFactory* library can be used as a staring point for user's extensions.

You can install the PyPi of *EOSFactory* with the `pip3` command:

```bash
pip3 install eosfactory-tokenika --user
```

Those two versions, GitHub and PyPi are identical in terms of codebase, while they differ in their folder structure.

The configuration can be printed with this command:

```bash
python3 -m eosfactory.config
```

In the printout, you'll see a note about the nature of the active package:

```bash
EOSFactory version 3.1.1.
Dependencies:
https://github.com/EOSIO/eos version 1.7.1
https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.cdt version 1.6.1
Python version 3.5 or higher

    EOSFactory is installed as a PyPi package.

The current configuration of EOSFactory:
{
    "CONFIG_FILE": "/mnt/c/Workspaces/EOS/eosfactory/config/config.json",
    "EOSIO_CDT_VERSION": [
        "1.6.1"
    ],
    "EOSIO_CLI_EXECUTABLE": "cleos",
    "EOSIO_CONTRACT_WORKSPACE": "/mnt/c/Workspaces/EOS/contracts",
    "EOSIO_CPP": "eosio-cpp",
    "EOSIO_CPP_DIR": "/usr/opt/eosio.cdt/1.6.1/",
..........................................
..........................................
```

>**NOTE:** We recommend installing the EOSFactory package locally. However, it can also be installed globally. When installed globally, tests have to be executed as `sudo`. However, if `KEOSD` operates locally (`$HOME/eosio-wallet`), it issues a misleading fatal error message complaining that the wallet already exists.

## Uninstalling

Make sure your working directory is switched to `eosfactory`:

```bash
cd eosfactory
```
Then

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```
Or, anywhere in the system, do
```bash
pip3 uninstall eosfactory-tokenika
```

## Troubleshooting specific errors

### Nodeos version error

There is a bug in `eosio nodeos` executable that makes it to response erratically. 
The command `python3 -m eosfactory.config` attempts to verify the version of the EOSIO installation, which is quite frequently unsuccessful and results in the following error message:

```bash
ERROR!
Cannot determine the version of the installed 'eosio' package.
The error message:
Command '['/usr/bin/nodeos', '--version']' returned non-zero exit status 255.
```

## Troubleshooting general problems

### Verify EOSFactory configuration

Make sure *EOSFactory* configuration is correct by running this command:

```bash
python3 -m eosfactory.config
```

As a result, you should get data similar to this:

```bash
EOSFactory version 3.1.1.
Dependencies:
https://github.com/EOSIO/eos version 1.7.1
https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.cdt version 1.6.1
Python version 3.5 or higher


    EOSFactory package is installed as a link to the directory:
    '/mnt/c/Workspaces/EOS/eosfactory/eosfactory/'


The current configuration of EOSFactory:

    "KEOSD_WALLET_DIR": "/home/cartman/eosio-wallet/",
    "LIBS": null,

    "WSL_ROOT": "C:/Users/cartman/AppData/Local/Packages/CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc/LocalState/rootfs"
}

You can overwrite the above settings with entries in the configuration
file located here:
/mnt/c/Workspaces/EOS/eosfactory/config/config.json


There are undefined setting:
{
    "LIBS": null,
    "NODEOS_STDOUT": null
}
```

Next, note the entries of the value `null`. Some of them signal configuration errors.

### Enable error traceback

Normally, error messages do not involve traceback. You can enable tracebacking:

```python
import eosfactory.core.setup as setup
setup.is_raise_error = True
```

### Verify command lines

Technically, EOSFactory wraps EOSIO executables -- namely `cleos`, `keos`, `nodeos` -- with its own API. Therefore, in error conditions, it makes sense to inspect command lines sent to the EOSIO executables. The boolean variable `eosfactory.core.setup.is_print_command_line` sets the debugging status. For example, if deployment of the contract in the test script `hello_world.py` fails, modify the script:

```python
        import eosfactory.core.setup as setUp   ## added
        setup.is_print_command_line = True      ## added
        smart.build()
        smart.deploy()
        setup.is_print_command_line = False     ## added
```

Now, if you run the script, you can see raw bash commands that can be inspected and tried:

```bash
######## command line sent to eosio-cpp:
/usr/bin/eosio-cpp -I=/mnt/c/Workspaces/EOS/eosfactory/contracts_windows/_wslqwjvacdyugodewiyd /mnt/c/Workspaces/EOS/eosfactory/contracts_windows/_wslqwjvacdyugodewiyd/src/_wslqwjvacdyugodewiyd.cpp:
WASM file writen to file: 
    /mnt/c/Workspaces/EOS/eosfactory/contracts_windows/_wslqwjvacdyugodewiyd/build/_wslqwjvacdyugodewiyd.wasm
######## command line sent to cleos:
/usr/bin/cleos --url http://127.0.0.1:8888 set contract kswquviprmbi /mnt/c/Workspaces/EOS/eosfactory/contracts_windows/_wslqwjvacdyugodewiyd build/_wslqwjvacdyugodewiyd.wasm build/_wslqwjvacdyugodewiyd.abi
```

### Verify communication with cleos

EOSFactory offers another debugging tool: printing requests send by `cleos` to `nodeos`, and responses from `nodeos`. For example, if deployment of the contract in the test script `hello_world.py` fails, modify the script:

```python
        import eosfactory.core.setup as setUp   ## added
        setup.is_print_command_line = True      ## added
        setup.is_print_request = True           ## added
        # setup.is_print_response = True        ## volume printout
        smart.build()
        smart.deploy()
        setup.is_print_request = False          ## added
        setup.is_print_command_line = False     ## added
        setup.is_print_response = False         ## added
```

## Subsequent installations

If you want to upgrade to the latest version of *EOSFactory*:

```bash
cd eosfactory
git pull
```

And then just run:

```bash
./install.sh
```
