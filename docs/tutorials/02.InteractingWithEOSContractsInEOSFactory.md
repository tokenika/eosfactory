# Interacting with EOS Contracts in *EOSFactory*

The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how *EOSFactory* and its Python CLI can be used to make interacting with EOS easy & intuitive.

## Prerequisites

* This tutorial assumes that you have successfully installed *EOSFactory*. If it's not the case, please refer to [Installing EOSFactory](01.InstallingEOSFactory.html).
* We also assume that you are familiar with the official [EOS tutorials](https://developers.eos.io/eosio-cpp/docs/introduction-to-smart-contracts), as they will give you a broader context and explain the rationale behind EOS smart-contracts.

## Run Python CLI

Open a bash terminal (or if you are on Windows, open an Ubuntu bash terminal supplied by *Windows Subsystem for Linux*) and run Python CLI:

```bash
python3
```

Once in the Python shell, import the *EOSFactory* library:

```python
from amaxfactory.eosf import *
```

## Start local testnet

To start your own single-node local testnet:

```python
reset()
```
Besides starting a reset `nodeos` executable, the command reset() cleans EOSFactory: deletes account objects, wallets, etc.

On MacOS the *EOSIO* process is run in the background with no visible interface. However in Ubuntu & Windows it's launched in a separate window.

To verify the *EOSIO* node is running or to get information about the current state of the testnet:

```python
info()
```

## Manage local testnet

To stop the current testnet:

```python
stop()
```

To continue running the same testnet:

```python
resume()
```

To stop the current testnet and start a new one:

```python
reset()
```

## Initialize workspace

First, make sure a local testnet is running:

```python
reset()
```

Next, create a master account from which other accounts can be created:

```python
create_master_account("master")
```

As a result, a global (in the current script) variable called `master` (or whatever name you pass as the parameter) is created and from now on you can use it anywhere in the code, for example:

```python
master.info()
```

>**NOTE:** The name `master` is just a name of a variable, not the actual name of the account created on the blockchain. The actual (physical) name of the account is `str(master)`.

You don't need to worry about locking or unlocking the wallet, managing its password or importing private keys into it. All of this is being taken care of by EOS Factory behind the scenes.

## Create accounts

Test accounts can be created using such command:

```python
create_account("charlie", master)
```

> Such actions happen while creating an account:
>* the given account name is checked for uniqueness, if positive, break;
>* a random physical name of the new account is determined;
>* two pairs of cryptographic keys are produced;
>* a wallet is opened and unlocked;
>* two private keys are imported to the wallet;
>* a new account is send to the blockchain;
>* confirmation from the blockchain is received.

Again, a global (in the current script) variable, this time called `charlie`, is created and from now on can be used anywhere in the code, for example:

```python
charlie.info()
```

>**NOTE:** If you don't specify the `account_name` parameter in `create_account()` which is the third parameter, a random name is applied, which is useful on a public testnet where extra restrictions apply. You can see it: `str(charlie)`

However, if you want to assign a specific name to an account, you can still do it, for example:

```python
create_account("charlie2", master, account_name="charlie4eos")
```

>**NOTE:** You cannot create the same account variable twice (EOSFactory protects yourself against non-uniqueness), that's why we use a different name for the variable to be created, i.e. `charlie2`.

And then run the `info()` command to verify that the `charlie4eos` name is actually assigned to the account referenced by the `charlie2` variable:

```python
charlie2.info()
```

## Create reference to an existing contract

We assume that a local testnet is running and initialized:

```python
reset()
create_master_account("master")
```

To create a reference to an already existing contract, first create an account which will host the contract:

```python
create_account("host", master)
```

And then create a reference to the contract by supplying the host account and the path to the folder where the contract is located, for example:

```python
smart = Contract(host, "/mnt/c/Workspaces/EOS/amaxfactory/contracts/eosio_token")
```

Alternatively, supply just the name of the folder, if it can be found in the standard location, i.e. `amaxfactory/contracts`, for example:

```python
smart = Contract(host, "eosio_token")
```

## Build the contract

Before deploying, the contract needs to be built from the source code. To build the contract invoke its `build()` method:

```python
smart.build()
```

## Deploy the contract

At this stage the contract has no code deployed. You can check it by running its `code()` method:

```python
smart.code()
```

To deploy the contract use its `deploy()` method:

```python
smart.deploy()
```

And now you can verify that the hash of the deployed code is non-zero:

```python
smart.code()
```

## Create the token

To create a new token we call the `create` action on the `eosio.token` contract:

```python
host.push_action(
    "create", 
    {
        "issuer": master,
        "maximum_supply": "1000000000.0000 EOS",
        "can_freeze": "0",
        "can_recall": "0",
        "can_whitelist": "0"
    }, [master, host])
```

>**NOTE:** The `push_action` method takes three arguments: the action's name, the action's arguments in JSON format and the accounts whose permission is needed, in this case `master` & `host`.

>**NOTE:** If you want to see the actual transaction without broadcasting it, use the `show_action` method instead of `push_action`, for example:

```python
host.show_action(
    "create", 
    {
        "issuer": master,
        "maximum_supply": "1000000000.0000 EOS",
        "can_freeze": "0",
        "can_recall": "0",
        "can_whitelist": "0"
    }, [master, host])
```

## Create more accounts

We'll need two accounts. To create them just run:

```python
create_account("alice", master)
create_account("carol", master)
```

## Issue tokens

Now that we have created the token, the issuer can issue new tokens to `alice`:

```python
host.push_action(
    "issue",
    {
        "to": alice, "quantity": "100.0000 EOS", "memo": ""
    },
    master)
```

>**NOTE:** In this case the permission is assigned to the default `master` account.

## Transfer tokens

Now that `alice` has tokens, we will transfer some of them to `carol`: 

```python
host.push_action(
    "transfer",
    {
        "from": alice, "to": carol,
        "quantity": "25.0000 EOS", "memo":""
    },
    alice)
```

>**NOTE:** As the third argument we pass the reference to the `alice` account to indicate that she is the one who authorized this action.

## Check the contract table

From the contract's ABI we know that the table keeping track of the token balances is called `accounts`.

Let's check the state of both accounts involved in the previous transaction:

```python
host.table("accounts", alice)
```

```python
host.table("accounts", carol)
```

>**NOTE:** The `table()` method takes two arguments: the name of the table as specified by the contract ABI and the scope within the contract in which the table is found.

This is the result you should get for `alice`:

```python
{
  "rows": [{
      "balance": "75.0000 EOS"
    }
  ],
  "more": False
}
```

And this is for `carol`:

```python
{
  "rows": [{
      "balance": "25.0000 EOS"
    }
  ],
  "more": False
}
```

## Stop testnet and exit Python

To stop the local testnet:

```python
stop()
```

To exit Python CLI:

```bash
exit()
```

Alternatively, use the `ctrl-D` shortcut.

## Run the tutorial

The python blocks in the current Markdown document can be executed with a provided bash tool. While the working directory is the root of the `EOSFactory` installation, do:

```bash
